# 🖋️ LibriNode Roadmap

Where the project has been and where it's going. Phases 0–5 are **complete**;
Phase 6 (hardening) is nearly done, with the remaining work gated on things
that take calendar time or external resources rather than code. The
fine-grained record of every change lives in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅

- Go backend + React frontend, compiled into **one self-contained binary** per OS
- SQLite (pure Go, no cgo) with an embedded, tested migrations framework
- Config file + `LIBRINODE_*` env overrides, rotating logs, cross-platform data dirs
- Versioned REST API (`/api/v1`) with API-key auth — the same API the UI uses
- CI building and testing on Windows and Linux; GPL-3.0

## Phase 1 — Library core ✅

- Author / Series / Book / Edition data model with **explicit per-format
  library membership** — a book belongs to Ebooks and/or Audiobooks only where
  you added or own that format, never by inference
- **Hardcover** metadata provider (live-verified): search, lookups, covers, editions
- Provider registry with hot-swap — token changes apply without a restart
- Library scanning that matches files in layers: **ISBN/ASIN identifiers**
  (from filenames or embedded epub metadata, checksum-validated) → exact
  author/title → **fuzzy suggestions**, offered for one-click confirmation but
  never auto-imported
- Existing-file import with 0–100% confidence ratings, duplicate resolution
  (replace/delete), and one-click adds for unknown authors/series/magazines
- Naming templates for every media type with live preview and
  **preview-then-apply** organize — library-, author-, series-, and book-scoped
- Scheduled + manual metadata refresh (per-record, per-library, global),
  honoring per-record provider overrides
- Local image cache: provider art served by LibriNode, surviving link rot

## Phase 2 — Acquisition ✅

- **Newznab/Torznab** indexer framework: per-type categories, Test buttons,
  per-indexer exponential failure backoff
- **Prowlarr application sync** (live-verified) — add LibriNode as a *Readarr*
  application and Prowlarr pushes both usenet and torrent indexers automatically
- Release parsing + scoring: formats, retail, language, year, narrators,
  bitrate, volume ranges, issue dates — book-aware search rejects wrong matches
  and ranks the rest
- Quality profiles per media type: ordered formats, language, size bounds, and
  **upgrade handling** with cutoffs; upgrades replace the old file
- **qBittorrent** and **SABnzbd** clients (live-verified through a debrid
  bridge): LibriNode resolves releases on its own side (magnet / `.torrent` /
  NZB upload), so NAT'd clients and Real-Debrid/TorBox bridges just work
- Completed Download Handling: automatic import, rename, clean-up, seed-goal
  awareness, and a failed-release blocklist with instant replacement search
- **Multi-book pack imports**: a "complete series" grab fills every matching
  book — matched by volume/title, never by size
- **Remote path mappings**: clients on other machines or in containers map
  their reported paths to local ones — longest prefix wins
- Automatic wanted-list sweeps (tunable cadence) + interactive per-book search

## Phase 3 — Five media types ✅

**Audiobooks** — a separate library from ebooks; audio-aware parsing
(narrator, bitrate, abridged rejection); multi-file books scanned, imported,
and organized as single units; Audiobookshelf-ready layouts with
`metadata.opf` sidecars.

**Manga & comics** — series-first libraries: **AniList** (keyless) or
**Hardcover** for manga, **Hardcover** or **ComicVine** for comics, switchable
with in-place re-sourcing; per-series Missing sections with selective or bulk
monitoring ("monitor future volumes" included); whole-series **pack search**
that ranks complete ranges above partial ones; `ComicInfo.xml` written into
imported CBZs; Kavita/Komga-ready layouts; covers from the provider or
extracted from the owned archive's first page; manga **colorized/monochrome
variants** owned side by side in one library.

**Magazines** — provider-less periodicals added by name; issues recognized by
date or number in filenames; scanning materializes owned issues; per-year
folder layouts. *Organize-only for now* — acquisition is disabled (the
magazine usenet landscape proved to be mostly disguised malware); the search
engine stays in the tree for when it returns.

## Phase 4 — Experience & administration ✅

- **Plex-style navigation**: a library appears only once you create it; poster
  grids with owned/total counts; author → book pages for prose, series pages
  for the rest; Home shows per-library Recently-added and Wanted rows
- Per-author and per-series **Missing** sections with one-click and bulk monitoring
- Per-library **Wanted** cards, a cross-library release **Calendar**, and a
  live **Activity** queue with grab history
- **Per-file actions** on detail pages: organize or delete a single file in place
- **Multi-user auth with roles**: admins run the server, members use it —
  enforced by the backend, not just hidden in the UI; sessions bound to their
  accounts; a first-run setup wizard; a visual folder browser
- **Light and dark themes** with an Auto mode that follows the OS live —
  per-browser preference, applied before first paint
- Grouped settings with Test buttons on every connection and advanced options
  tucked behind toggles
- Health checks every 15 minutes with self-explaining banners that distinguish
  "unreachable" from "rejected credentials" and recover on their own
- Backups (consistent DB snapshot + config) with **staged restore**; a log
  viewer with rotation; delete-from-disk options that never escape a root folder
- Packaging: Dockerfile + compose, systemd unit, Windows scripts, release CI

## Phase 5 — Reach ✅

Extending past what the standard *arr APIs can see:

- **Native indexer framework**: built-in Go sources selected as an indexer
  *type* — no Newznab endpoint — feeding the same search/scoring/grab
  pipeline, and hidden from Prowlarr so sync never collides. **Off by
  default, user-enabled, user-responsible** (the same dual-use posture as
  Prowlarr's own definitions)
- **AudioBook Bay** (audiobooks): scrapes listings and assembles the magnet
  from the on-page info hash + trackers; rides the normal torrent path;
  primary + fallback site URLs for its rotating domains
- **Anna's Archive** (ebooks): keyless search *and* keyless downloads —
  free-first by design, routing through Anna's own free "slow" servers and
  the open mirror network by MD5, no account needed; an optional membership
  key only appends the paid fast-download API as a last-resort fallback
- **Library Genesis** (ebooks): both indexes (non-fiction + fiction)
  searched and merged; downloads via the same open-mirror failover — the
  general shadow-library layer, not tied to any one site
- **`direct` download protocol**: LibriNode's own HTTP fetcher — mirror-list
  failover, membership-API and landing-page awareness, progress in the
  queue, imported like any other grab; any direct-link source can ride it
- **Metadata fallbacks**: Open Library and Google Books (both keyless) answer
  only when the primary draws a blank; records remember their source so
  refreshes route back to it
- Credential hygiene throughout: keys and tokens are scrubbed from every
  error, banner, and log line

## Phase 6 — Hardening & release 🔄

Turning "works on the dev box" into "trustable release". Done so far:

- ✅ Live end-to-end verification: Prowlarr sync, torrents and NZBs through a
  TorBox/Real-Debrid bridge — search → grab → download → import → organized file
- ✅ Automated **migration testing** (old-schema fixtures driven through the
  full chain — migration bugs are data-loss bugs) and an automated
  **clean-machine restore drill**
- ✅ Failure-mode polish: provider outages, stuck indexers, and vanishing
  download clients all degrade into readable banners and recover on their own
- ✅ Security pass: session binding, constant-time key checks, path-traversal
  audit, and a token-leak sweep with regression tests
- ✅ Performance pass at ~11,000-book scale (batched scan transactions cut a
  cold scan from 32s to 2.5s; oversized payloads trimmed)
- ✅ Release hygiene: version-stamped builds, a CHANGELOG, `v0.9.0-rc` tags
  proving the release CI end to end, and **published Docker images on GHCR**

Remaining — externally gated:

- [ ] ⏳ **Real-world burn-in**: weeks of daily use with real libraries, messy
  release names, and provider rate limits
- [ ] ⏳ **Live ComicVine verification** (needs an API key; comics run on
  Hardcover today)
- [ ] ⏳ **Docs stranger-test**: a fresh person follows the quickstart from
  scratch (the code-audit pass is done; the human walkthrough remains)
- [ ] ⏳ **Code-signed Windows installer** that passes Smart App Control
  (needs a signing certificate)

**1.0 ships when burn-in comes back clean and the installer is signed.**

## Future 💡

Under consideration, in no particular order:

- [ ] **Magazine metadata**: Wikidata as a series enricher (publisher, ISSN,
  publication frequency feeding Calendar predictions) + Internet Archive for
  vintage per-issue records
- [ ] **Import lists**: Hardcover want-to-read shelf → auto-monitor
- [ ] **External notifications**: Discord/webhook/email on grab, import,
  upgrade, and failure
- [ ] **Reader integrations**: notify Calibre, Kavita, Komga, or
  Audiobookshelf on import
- [ ] **Accessibility, the systematic pass**: focus trapping, full keyboard
  paths, a screen-reader walk of the main flows
- [ ] **Localization** — and with it, language/date preferences
- [ ] `ComicInfo.xml` for CBR archives (needs a RAR writer)
