# Changelog

Notable changes to LibriNode. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow semver once
tagged releases begin (v0.9.0-rc is planned as the first).

## [Unreleased]

Everything to date — Phases 0–5 (feature-complete) plus the pre-1.0 hardening
in progress. Highlights from the hardening period, newest first:

### Added
- Live download progress: Activity queue rows carry progress bars and per-line
  remove; blocklist and history collapse into dropdowns; a book page's badge
  turns "downloading N%" while its grab is active and reverts on its own.
  Queue responses are served from a shared 15-second snapshot so open pages
  never stampede the download clients.
- Richer default file naming across all libraries: per-book ebook folders,
  author/title/year in file names, zero-padded volume/issue numbers.
- Home page tiles link to their book or series page; the book page's
  cross-format badge links to the same book in the other library; multi-file
  audiobooks list their tracks on the book page.
- Junk/spam defense: releases naming an executable are rejected before grab;
  completed downloads with wrong content (or an executable payload) are
  blocklisted, deleted from the client *and* disk, and immediately re-searched;
  completed-but-never-readable paths are abandoned after a grace period.
- Import handling options (Settings → Download Clients), all on by default:
  import whole packs, remove completed downloads from the client, delete the
  downloaded files after import.
- Debrid-bridge support (Real-Debrid/TorBox style): LibriNode resolves
  releases on its own side — NZB fetched and uploaded via SABnzbd `addfile`,
  torrents passed as magnets or uploaded `.torrent` bytes — and tolerates
  slow bridge adds by confirming against the client's list.
- Multi-disc audiobooks: disc subfolders (CD1/Disc 02/Part 3) survive import
  and scan as one book unit; other nesting is flattened collision-safely.

### Fixed
- An import whose organized target already exists on disk but is unrecorded
  now adopts the file instead of skipping forever with the grab stuck.
- Format-less release names (manga/comic/magazine/audiobook convention) are
  scored instead of rejected; series/magazine title matching is whole-word so
  short titles no longer false-match longer ones.
- Failed and junk downloads have their data deleted directly on disk as well,
  covering clients that ignore the delete-files flag.

### Changed
- Unstamped (dev) builds now report `dev-<sha> (<date>)` from the embedded
  build info instead of a stale placeholder; releases keep stamping real
  versions via ldflags.

Earlier work (Phases 0–5) is chronicled in the README's roadmap section:
libraries for ebooks/audiobooks/manga/comics/magazines, Hardcover/AniList/
ComicVine metadata, Prowlarr sync, quality profiles and upgrades, Completed
Download Handling with multi-book pack imports, per-library UI, health checks,
authentication, backups, packaging, and the docs site.
